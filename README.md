### Welcome to my Portfolio's Repo!

## How to Play
Each building represents a section of my portfolio. Clicking on the corresponding door
directs the character (me) to walk towards it. Once I have arrived at the door
you'll be able to learn a little more about me. 

## About My Portfolio
It was developed entirely with React. All of the art was created by me in MSPaint, except for the 
character sprite. That was derived from one of my favorite games, Stardew Valley (I am horrible at drawing 
people, so thank you ConcernedApe!).

## Please Feel Free to Leave Me Feedback or Comments at the Bulletin Board on the Pier. Thanks!
